# Predicting Profitable Trades Using Random Forest Model

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to load a pre-trained Random Forest model, preprocess new financial data, and predict profitable trades. The model was created and saved in a previous step, and this notebook loads the model, processes new data, and outputs trade predictions.

## Data Source
Collected over time from Kucoin API

## Requirements
To run the notebook, you will need the following libraries:
- `yfinance`
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `joblib`

You can install these libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install yfinance pandas numpy scikit-learn joblib
