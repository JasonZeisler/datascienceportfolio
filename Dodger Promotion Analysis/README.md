# Dodger Promotion Analysis

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze the impact of special events or promotions (e.g., cap giveaways, shirt giveaways, fireworks) on game attendance at Dodgers baseball games. The dataset includes information on game dates, opponents, weather, promotions, and attendance figures, and we seek to understand if specific promotions significantly affect crowd sizes.

## Requirements
To run the analysis, you will need the following Python libraries:
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`

You can install these libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib
