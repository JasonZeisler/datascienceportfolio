# Predicting Stock Prices Using LSTM Model

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to use a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to predict stock prices. The model is trained on historical stock data, focusing on the closing price, volume, and moving average features. The model uses sequences of past stock data to predict future stock prices.

## Requirements
To run this notebook, you will need the following libraries:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `tensorflow` (for building and training the LSTM model)
- `sklearn` (for data scaling)

Install the necessary libraries with:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy tensorflow scikit-learn
