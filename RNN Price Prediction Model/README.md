# Bitcoin Price Prediction Using RNN (LSTM)

## Project Overview
This project uses a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers to predict Bitcoin prices. The model is trained on historical Bitcoin price data and uses past price sequences to forecast future prices.

## Requirements
To run this script, you need the following Python libraries:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `tensorflow` (for building and training the RNN model)
- `sklearn` (for data normalization)
- `matplotlib` (for visualizing the predictions)

You can install these dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas tensorflow scikit-learn matplotlib
