# Data Science Portfolio by Jason Zeisler

## About Me and My Work:
My name is Jason. I'm a data scientist at a Fintech company. I have many years of software engineering and database developer and I made the transition to data scientist because I highly enjoy working with data to find useful patterns for realworld applications. 

I love data science and I try to find way to use it for personal projects. Some of my areas of interests are using ML for financial markets, but something when curiosity gets the best of me other uses arise. My work here is from personal projects and from projects completed during my coursework for my Master's in Data Science.

Two topics that highly interest me are financial markets, as previously mentioned, but also financial fraud detection. They are two things where the root of change is human emotions, primarily greed, and this can really add a lot of complexity.

## Purpose of this GitHub account:
I want to use this account to show work that I've completed in a educational environment as well as personal projects. I am always wanting to learn and the best way to learn for me is to get hands-on. So if that means creating a project to test out a ML model to understand it's implementation I'll be putting it here.

## Projects

### Trade Analysis Modeling
This project was an exercise in finding optimal buy, and eventually sell, signals. It is a work in progress. It was a way for me to think through feature engineering for financial data, particularly for cryptocurrencies, and then apply ML to that dataset. Future work is to do the same for sell signals and then backtest this against new data and other markets, like securities.

### Stock Market Sentiment Analysis
This project was to determine if news headline sentiment analysis would be sufficient in determining changes in prices for the DJIA.

### Sales Predictions
This project analyzes and predicts monthly retail sales using time series data.

### RNN Price Prediction Model
This project uses a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers to predict Bitcoin prices. The model is trained on historical Bitcoin price data and uses past price sequences to forecast future prices.

### Movie Reccommendations
This project builds a movie recommendation system using user ratings. It aims to suggest movies based on the preferences of users and the ratings they have given to different movies.

### Loan Offers
This project builds a model to determine candidates for loan offers.

### Predicting Stock Prices Using LSTM Model
This project demonstrates how to use a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to predict stock prices. The model is trained on historical stock data, focusing on the closing price, volume, and moving average features. The model uses sequences of past stock data to predict future stock prices.

### Dodger Promotion Analysis
This project aims to analyze the impact of special events or promotions on game attendance at Dodgers baseball games. The dataset includes information on game dates, opponents, weather, promotions, and attendance figures, and we seek to understand if specific promotions significantly affect crowd sizes.

### Bank Loan Offer Model
This project aims to predict which deposit-only customers at a bank can be converted into asset customers (i.e., those who take out loans). The ability to predict customer behavior allows the bank to focus its marketing efforts more effectively, increasing revenue by targeting customers likely to take out loans.

### ALS Patient Data Clustering
This project aims to perform clustering analysis on ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) patient data using K-Means clustering. The goal is to group patients into clusters based on their medical data to uncover patterns that may be useful for research or treatment strategies.
